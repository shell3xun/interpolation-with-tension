I am writing to submit our manuscript “Smoothing and Interpolating Noisy GPS Data with Smoothing Splines” for consideration as a publication in IEEE TSP. This manuscripts presents statistical methods for smoothing noisy, irregularly sampled GPS signals and includes a complete implementation of well tested classes in Matlab. We believe these results and the numerical implementation will be useful to the readers of IEEE TSP.

This manuscript has not been presented or submitted for publication anywhere else. All authors have contributed to this manuscript and have no conflicts of interest.

Thank you for your consideration,
