Thank you for inviting us to submit a revised manuscript and response to reviewers. The revision and detailed reviewer responses are attached.

The primary addition to the manuscript is the addition of a new section comparing to other methods for smoothing and interpolating drifter positions. This section adds both a broader context and specific comparisons of methodology. The second major change to the manuscript is a reduction in word count to accommodate the new section. 


Thank you for your consideration,
