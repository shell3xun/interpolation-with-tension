pages = {377--403},
annote = {The condition implied by equation 1.4 is, of course, bad. He's requiring the sample variance equal the variance...this will be over tensioned.

The mean square error in 1.5 does NOT include interpolated points, only observed points.

1.6 -> 1.7 follows because,
ER = || A y - g ||^2,
ER = || A (g+\epsilon) - g ||^2
ER = || (A - I) g  + A \epsilon ||^2
ER = || (A - I) g ||^2 + 2 || (A-I) g A \epsilon || + || A \epsilon ||^2
ER = || (A - I) g ||^2 + \sigma^2 Tr A^2

If your solution is I, then the lh term is zero, and the rhs is just the variance.

To get to theorem 1.1, you do the same process again and substitute g = y-\epsilon. But, this seems recursive. In fact,
(I-A)^2 = I - 2 A + A^2
so,
-Tr( I - 2 A + A^2) + Tr(A^2) = -N + 2 Tr(A) 

So, I'd argue,
(1/N) || (I - A) y ||^2  - sigma^2 + sigma^2/N Tr(A)
